# Work Day Scheduler

This project is a daily calendar which displays the current date at the top of the page then dislays the hours of a usual workday in a column. In each hour block you can type in a task and save it. Then the calendar tracks the current hour greying out the hours that have past, highlighting the current hour in red, and highlighting the upcoming hours in green.
